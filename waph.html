        Course Information:The "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course
        covers languages like HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, and MySQL and offers
        a thorough overview of front-end and back-end web development. It
        emphasizes secure programming principles and uses practical exercises to
        examine vulnerabilities and attacks in web applications. Web and web
        application development, client-side and server-side programming, Git
        version control, and DevOps procedures are among the subjects covered in
        the syllabus. Web application security is also covered in detail in the
        course. A project-based approach that includes labs, hackathons,
        individual projects, and a team project focused on developing a
        real-world application deployed in cloud.

        Lab1 covers the usage of Wireshark to check how the HTTP protocol
        request and response works through telnet and browser. The second part
        assignment includes developing CGI applications in c, compiling and
        deploying in web server and showcased the deployment of the CGI code
        with the HTML template. Developing and deploying PHP web application
        with user input and understanding the HTTP GET Requests and Responses.
        Commands like curl are used to create an HTTP POST request.

      <h4 id="lab2">
        This lab involves creating an interactive web page, "waph-mandadui.html"
        covering HTML structure, JavaScript functionalities (current date/time
        when clicked, key logging, digital and analog clocks), Ajax requests to
        "echo.php" for user input, CSS styling (inline, internal, external), and
        jQuery integration for dynamic content display. Further, explored into
        Web API integration, utilizing jQuery Ajax for programming-related jokes
        from "https://v2.jokeapi.dev" and the fetch() method for age prediction
        from "https://api.agify.io." Inspected network connections to gain
        practical knowledge. Practical understanding of web development, from
        fundamental components to advanced features and external API interfaces,
        is enhanced by accomplishing these tasks.

        This Hackathon provides an understanding of XSS attacks and adopting
        secure coding practices as per OWASP guidelines. It consists of two
        tasks,it involves exploiting vulnerabilities in
        http://waph-hackathon.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/xss/ through six levels
        of attacks in Task 1, followed by implementing input validation and
        output sanitization to counter XSS attacks in Task 2. The documentation
        is in Markdown style, and a PDF report is generated with Pandoc,
        underlining the significance of protecting against XSS attacks in web
        development.
